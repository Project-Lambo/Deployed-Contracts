## A Dive Into Contract Engineering &mdash; For Software Devs

### Reliance on External Libraries

In our pursuit of creating robust and tailored smart contracts, we've harnessed a blend of carefully chosen external libraries in conjunction with our custom code. This amalgamation acknowledges and attributes credit to the open-source code that has contributed to our engineering process. Specifically, we've leveraged the following libraries:

- OpenZeppelin
- Ownable
- Strings

### Smart Contract Implementation: Decisions & Details

Project Lambo has chosen to implement its 6 unique contracts as ERC-1155 tokens, building upon the solid foundation provided by the OpenZeppelin library. To ensure smooth and controlled operations, several customisations have been incorporated into the contracts, adding a layer of restrictions and custom functionality.

- `mint ( .... ) & mintBatch ( .... ):` One notable customization revolves around the token minting process. The minting functionality, encompassing both single and batch minting, has been thoughtfully overridden. Access to these minting functions is now exclusive to the contract owner, achieved through the `OnlyOwner` modifier. This enhancement not only bolsters security by restricting critical operations but also introduces safeguards like defining maximum NFT limits and implementing comprehensive NFT ID range checks.

- `safeTransferFrom ( .... ) & safeBatchTransferFrom ( .... ):` Building on the principle of controlled access to our contract, the safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom functions have been customized as well. To maintain a controlled trading environment, a custom modifier named `isTransferAllowed` has been introduced. Through this modifier, Project Lambo enforces a specific restriction: the trading of NFTs is temporarily disabled for a designated period after deployment, specifically until August 13th, 2023. This tactical approach allows Project Lambo to exert a measured level of influence over the initial trading phase, granting the ecosystem time to stabilize before enabling full public trading.

- `uri ( .... ):` Recognizing the pivotal role that metadata plays in enhancing the NFT experience, Project Lambo has also extended the uri function. This function is primarily queried by various marketplaces to retrieve the full metadata URL for NFTs. The actual metadata is, of course, hosted off-chain on Project Lambo's private servers. By thoughtfully handling metadata range and IDs, Project Lambo can ensure the integrity and availability of NFT-related information while seamlessly accommodating external marketplaces.
